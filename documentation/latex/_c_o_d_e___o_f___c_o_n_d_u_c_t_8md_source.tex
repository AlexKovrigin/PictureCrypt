00001 # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
00002 
00003 ## Our Pledge
00004 
00005 In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers
       pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
       regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
       nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
00006 
00007 ## Our Standards
00008 
00009 Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
00010 
00011 * Using welcoming and inclusive language
00012 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
00013 * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
00014 * Focusing on what is best for the community
00015 * Showing empathy towards other community members
00016 
00017 Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
00018 
00019 * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
00020 * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
00021 * Public or private harassment
00022 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit
       permission
00023 * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
00024 
00025 ## Our Responsibilities
00026 
00027 Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are
       expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
00028 
00029 Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
       code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
       temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
       offensive, or harmful.
00030 
00031 ## Scope
00032 
00033 This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is
       representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an
       official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
       representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by
       project maintainers.
00034 
00035 ## Enforcement
00036 
00037 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the
       project team at a.kovrigin0@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will
       respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
       confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies
       may be posted separately.
00038 
00039 Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary
       or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
